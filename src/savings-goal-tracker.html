    <h2>Challenge 2: Savings Goal Tracker</h2>
    <p>
      Summary: You want to save a certain amount of money and want to track how many
      months it will take to reach your savings goal.
    </p>
    <p>Write a function called calculateSavingsMonths that takes three parameters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>savingsGoal (number) - The amount of money you want to save (in dollars).</li>
      <li>
        monthlySavings (number) - The amount of money you can save per month (in dollars).
      </li>
      <li>
        interestRate (number) - The annual interest rate on your savings account (in
        percentage).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The function should calculate and return the number of months it will take for you
      to reach your savings goal, considering your monthly savings and the interest earned
      on your savings account.
    </p>

    <script>
      // utility function
      function calculateSavingsMonths(savingsGoal, monthlySavings, interestRate) {
        if (
          typeof savingsGoal !== "number" ||
          typeof monthlySavings !== "number" ||
          typeof interestRate !== "number"
        ) {
          throw new Error("Invalid input");
        }

        let months = 0;
        let currentSavings = 0;

        while (currentSavings < savingsGoal) {
          currentSavings += monthlySavings;
          let monthlyInterest = (currentSavings * interestRate) / 1200;
          currentSavings += monthlyInterest;
          months++;
        }

        return { months: months, savings: currentSavings.toFixed(2) };
      }
    </script>
