    <h2>Challenge 1: Distance Travel Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      Summary: You are going on a road trip and want to calculate how many days it will
      take to reach your destination based on your daily travel distance.
    </p>
    <p>Write a function called calculateTravelDays that takes three parameters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        totalDistance (number) - The total distance you need to travel (in kilometers).
      </li>
      <li>
        dailyDistance (number) - The distance you can cover in a day (in kilometers).
      </li>
      <li>
        restDays (number) - The number of rest days you plan to take during the trip.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The function should calculate and return the number of days it will take for you to
      reach your destination, considering your travel distance per day and the rest days
      you plan to take.
    </p>

    <script>
      // utility function
      function calculateTravelDays(totalDistance, dailyDistance, restDays) {
        if (
          typeof totalDistance !== "number" ||
          typeof dailyDistance !== "number" ||
          typeof restDays !== "number"
        ) {
          throw new Error("Invalid input.");
        }

        let travelDays = 0;
        travelDays = Math.floor((totalDistance / dailyDistance) + restDays);

        return travelDays;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
