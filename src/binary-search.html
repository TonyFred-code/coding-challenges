    <h2>Challenge: Binary Search</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Binary search is an efficient algorithm to find a specific element in a sorted
        array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implement a function that performs a binary search to find the target element in
        the sorted array.
      </p>
      <p>
        The binary search algorithm compares the target element with the middle element of
        the array, and based on the comparison, narrows down the search range by half in
        each iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue the search until the target element is found or the search range becomes
        empty.
      </p>

      <h3>Test Cases</h3>
      <p>
        Test Case 1: Search for an element that exists in the middle of the sorted array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test Case 2: Search for an element that exists at the beginning of the sorted
        array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test Case 3: Search for an element that exists at the end of the sorted array.
      </p>
      <p>Test Case 4: Search for an element that does not exist in the sorted array.</p>
